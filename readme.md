# aeyxa.com

This is a personal website created by Kian Thomas Falcone aka aeyxa. The main purpose of this website is for storing and sharing personal projects. Currently, the primary feature available to users is the ability to create note cards. Another project available on github, named "aeyxabot" allows users to automatically create note cards from Wikipedia using a web crawler with a simple data parsing algorithm using regular expressions. Support for low level machine leveling by adding new regular expressions as users update their cards.
